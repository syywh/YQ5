(still uncompleted, coming soon....)

This is a long-term visual localization dataset collected in campus environment. The five trajectories are collected in 2017-08-23, 2017-08-24, 2017-08-28 and 2018-01-29,in which the trajectory of 2017-08-24 is opposite to the other four trajectories. You can download the dataset [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1KXRSEvJBoRsVfYQJjHc8ig) with passward `d43p`.


There are another 21 sessions of data collected in 2017-03-03, 2017-03-07 and 2017-03-09 along almost the same trajectory, which we used to build the map in our work to test the long term visual localization. You can find the data [here](https://tangli.site/projects/academic/yq21/).
